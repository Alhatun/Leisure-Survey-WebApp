## Insighter Web App Overview:

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Insighter web application! Our app has been designed with a focus on creating an efficient and visually engaging user experience. The survey questions have been streamlined to minimize choice paralysis and encourage participation. The interface features a sliding display of pictures showcasing various projects, which is accompanied by a brief description of the surveyâ€™s aim.

## Survey Questions:

Our survey is designed to capture valuable demographic data such as age, gender, income range, and education level. We also ask about disability status and the presence of company during leisure activities to better understand accessibility and social dynamics.

In addition to demographic data, our survey questions delve into the emotional experiences of participants, their satisfaction with services, staff behavior, and event organization. This feedback helps us improve the quality of leisure offerings and increase user satisfaction.

Furthermore, we include questions about leisure budget and repeat experiences to help stakeholders tailor their offerings and determine the likelihood of future participation. By gathering this information, we can make informed decisions that improve the overall user experience.


## Technology Used

To enhance user experience, we also utilized JavaScript to enable multi-language support and Bootstrap to ensure our website was responsive on devices of all sizes. Additionally, we relied on SQL to provide efficient and reliable data storage and retrieval for our survey results.
